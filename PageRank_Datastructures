One Time Setup before first query:
1. run crawler.py on urls.txt

In crawler.py:
- need to create link datastructure and store incoming+outgoing links and store in persistent database
- store the backend datastructures from lab1 in persistent database (document_index,...)

2. run pagerank.py and store the result in persistent database




During every query:

1. Filter all doc_id's that match query word using document_index
2. sort result from one based on pageRank
3. display
