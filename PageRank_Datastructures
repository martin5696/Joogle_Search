PageRank Datastructures



One Time Setup before first query:
1. run crawler.py on urls.txt

In crawler.py:
- need to create link datastructure and store incoming+outgoing links and store in persistent database
- store the backend datastructures from lab1 in persistent database (document_index,...)

2. run pagerank.py and store the result in persistent database


Data structures that need to be stored persistently:
- Page Rank scores ([doc_id:score])
- self.document_index
- self.links_by_doc_id (used by pagerank.py)



During every query:

1. Filter all doc_id's that match query word (need to access document_index)
2. sort result from one based on pageRank score (need to access Page Rank Scores)
#note that 1,2 above both work return doc_id. 
3. display (need title, url, first 20 words. need to access document_index document_index)
